## Description

Created a prework study guide to help new and struggling bootcamp students, where I learned how to start an HTML document, later style it with CSS, then added JavaScript, and lastly have it connected with GitHub.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
